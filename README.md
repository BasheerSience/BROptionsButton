2) instance of UItabBar (of course) <br>

How to use it:
==================
- import BROptionsButton.h

```Objective-C
#import "BROptionsButton.h"
```

- Initialize new button 
```Objective-C
// the index 1 is the center for UITabBar with 3 buttons
// the delegate must be setted  
 BROptionsButton *brOption = [[BROptionsButton alloc] initForTabBar:self.tabBar forItemIndex:1 delegate:self];
```
- Customize the button. Set images for different states 

```Objective-C
[brOption setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple"] forBROptionsButtonState:BROptionsButtonStateNormal];
[brOption setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"close"] forBROptionsButtonState:BROptionsButtonStateOpened];
```

- Respond to the formal protocol messages 

```Objective-C
// number of items 
- (NSInteger)brOptionsButtonNumberOfItems:(BROptionsButton *)brOptionsButton
{
    return 4;
}

// respond to selection (show viewController, animation, alert...)
- (void)brOptionsButton:(BROptionsButton *)brOptionsButton didSelectItem:(BROptionItem *)item
{
    [self setSelectedIndex:brOptionsButton.locationIndexInTabBar];
}
```

- Respond to informal protocol messages to have more customizations

```Objective-C
// custom image for this item.
// nil will make rounded button with default background color
- (UIImage*)brOptionsButton:(BROptionsButton *)brOptionsButton imageForItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
{
    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple"];
    return image;
}

// do any setups before displaying the button
- (void)brOptionsButton:(BROptionsButton*)optionsButton willDisplayButtonItem:(BROptionItem*)button {
    button.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
}


- (NSString*)brOptionsButton:(BROptionsButton*)brOptionsButton titleForItemAtIndex:(NSInteger)index {
   return @"buttonTitle";
}
```
